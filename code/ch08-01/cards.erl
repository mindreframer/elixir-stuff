%% Do a Fisher-Yates shuffle of a deck
-spec(shuffle([card()])-> [card()]).

shuffle(List) -> shuffle(List, []).

%% If the list is empty, return the accumulated value.
shuffle([], Acc) -> Acc;

%% Otherwise, find a random location in the list and split the list
%% at that location. Let's say the list has 52 elements and the random
%% location is location 22. The first 22 elements go into Leading, and the
%% last 30 elements go into [H|T]. Thus, H would contain element 23, and
%% T would contain elements 24 through 52.
%%
%% H is the "chosen element". It goes into the accumulator (the shuffled list)
%% and then we call shuffle again with the remainder of the deck: the 
%% leading elements and the tail of the split list.

shuffle(List, Acc) ->
  {Leading, [H | T]} = lists:split(random:uniform(length(List)) - 1, List),
  shuffle(Leading ++ T, [H | Acc]).
