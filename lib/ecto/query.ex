defmodule Ecto.Query do
  @moduledoc """
  This module is the query DSL. Queries are used to fetch data from a repository
  (see `Ecto.Repo`).

  ## Examples

      import Ecto.Query

         from w in Weather,
       where: w.prcp > 0,
      select: w.city

  The above example will create a query that can be run against a repository.
  `from` will bind the variable `w` to the entity `Weather` (see `Ecto.Entity`).
  If there are multiple from expressions the query will run for every
  permutation of their combinations. `where` is used to filter the results,
  multiple `where`s can be given. `select` selects which results will be
  returned, a single variable can be given, that will return the full entity, or
  a single field. Multiple fields can also be grouped in lists or tuples. Only
  one `select` expression is allowed.

  External variables and elixir expressions can be injected into a query
  expression with `^`. Anything that isn't inside a `^` expression is treated
  as a query expression.

  This allows one to create dynamic queries:

      def with_minimum(age, height_ft) do
        from u in User,
        where: u.age > ^age and u.height > ^(height_ft * 3.28)
      end

  In the example above, we will compare against the `age` given as argument.
  Notice the `select` clause is optional, Ecto will automatically infer and
  returns the user record (similar to `select: u`) from the query above.

  ## Extensions

  Queries are composable and can be extend dynamically. This allows you to
  create specific queries given a parameter:

      query = from w in Weather, select: w.city
      if filter_by_prcp do
        query = extend w in query, where: w.prcp > 0
      end
      Repo.all(query)

  Or even create functions that extend an existing query:

      def paginate(query, page, size) do
        extend query,
          limit: size,
          offset: (page-1) * size
      end

      query |> paginate |> Repo.all

  ## Query expansion

  In the examples above, we have used the so-called **keywords query syntax**
  to create a query. Our first example:

      import Ecto.Query

         from w in Weather,
       where: w.prcp > 0,
      select: w.city

  Simply expands to the following **query expressions**:

      from(w in Weather) |> where([w], w.prcp > 0) |> select([w], w.city)

  Which then expands to:

      select(where(from(w in Weather), [w], w.prcp > 0), [w], w.city)

  This module documents each of those macros, providing examples both
  in the keywords query and in the query expression formats.

  Creates a query. It can either be a keyword query or a query expression. If it
  is a keyword query the first argument should be an `in` expression and the
  second argument a keyword query where they keys are expression types and the
  values are expressions.

  If it is a query expression the first argument is the original query and the
  second argument the expression.

  ## Keywords examples

  ## Expressions examples

      from(City) |> select([c], c)

  # Extending queries

  An existing query can be extended with `from` by appending the given
  expressions to it.

  The existing variables from the original query can be rebound by
  giving the variables on the left hand side of `in`. The bindings
  are order dependent, that means that each variable will be bound to
  the variable in the original query that was defined in the same order
  as the binding was in its list.

  ## Examples

      def paginate(query, page, size) do
        from query,
          limit: size,
          offset: (page-1) * size
      end

  The example above does not rebinding any variable, as they are not
  required for `limit` and `offset`. However, extending a query with
  where expression would require so:

      def published(query) do
        from p in query, where: p.published_at != nil
      end

  Notice we have rebound the term `p`. In case the given query has
  more than one `from` expression, each of them must be given in
  the order they were bound:

      def published_multi(query) do
        from [p,o] in query,
        where: p.published_at != nil and o.published_at != nil
      end

  A join query expression. Receives an entity that is to be joined to the query
  and a condition to do the joining on. The join condition can be any expression
  that evaluates to a boolean value. The join is by default an inner join, the
  qualifier can be changed by giving the atoms: `:inner`, `:left`, `:right` or
  `:full`. For a keyword query the `:join` keyword can be changed to:
  `:inner_join`, `:left_join`, `:right_join` or `:full_join`.

  The join condition can be automatically set when doing an association join. An
  association join can be done on any association field (`has_many`, `has_one`,
  `belong_to`).

  A select query expression. Selects which fields will be selected from the

  The `assoc/2` selector can be used to load an association on a parent entity

  variable bound in the `from` query expression, the second has to be a variable
  bound in an association join on the `from` variable.
