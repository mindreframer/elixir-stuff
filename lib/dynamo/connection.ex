  This modules defines the connection API.

  By default, Elixir ships with two implementations
  of this API: `Dynamo.Cowboy.Connection` (used by
  Cowboy web server) and `Dynamo.Connection.Test`.

  Notice that this module documentation uses the record
  notation. So although the documentation says `params(conn)`,
  the function should be invoked as `conn.params()` and
  Elixir automatically moves the `conn` to the last argument.

  It is also important to remind that, as in all Elixir
  structures, a connection is immutable. So if you are using
  `conn.put_resp_header("X-API", "123456")` to set a response
  header, a new connection will be returned with the new header
  set. The original `conn` is not going to be modified.
