#Amrita

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/josephwilk/amrita.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/josephwilk/amrita)

A polite, well mannered and thoroughly upstanding testing framework for [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/).

![Elixir of life](http://s9.postimg.org/uv0ubzjm7/elixir.jpg)

##Install

Add to your mix.exs

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      {:amrita, "0.1.1", github: "josephwilk/amrita"}
    ]
  end
```

After adding Amrita as a dependency, to install please run:

```console
mix deps.get
```

##Getting started

Ensure you start Amrita in: test/test_helper.exs
```elixir
Amrita.start
```

Create a new test file ending with "_test.exs".

Require test_helper.exs in every test (this will ensure Amrita is started):

Mix in `Amrita.Sweet` which will bring in everything you need to use Amrita:

```elixir
Code.require_file "../test_helper.exs", __FILE__

defmodule ExampleFacts do
  use Amrita.Sweet

end
```

Now all thats left is to  write some tests!

## Checkers

Amrita is all about checkers!

```elixir
Code.require_file "../test_helper.exs", __FILE__

defmodule ExampleFacts do
  use Amrita.Sweet

  facts "about Amrita checkers" do
    fact "contains checks if an element is in a collection" do
      [1, 2, 4, 5] |> contains 4

      {6, 7, 8, 9} |> contains 9

      [a: 1, :b 2] |> contains {:a, 1}
    end

    fact "! negates a checker" do
      [1, 2, 3, 4] |> !contains 9999

     # or you can add a space, like this. Whatever tickles your fancy.

      [1, 2, 3, 4] |> ! contains 9999

      10 |> ! equal 11
    end

    fact "contains works with strings" do
      "mad hatters tea party" |> contains "hatters"

      "mad hatter tea party" |> contains %r"h(\w+)er"
    end

    fact "has_prefix checks if the start of a collection matches" do
      [1, 2, 3, 4] |> has_prefix [1, 2]

      {1, 2, 3, 4} |> has_prefix {1, 2}

      "I cannot explain myself for I am not myself" |> has_prefix "I"
    end

    fact "has_suffix checks if the end of a collection matches" do
      [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5] |> has_suffix [4, 5]

      {1, 2, 3, 4} |> has_suffix {3, 4}

      "I cannot explain myself for I am not myself" |> has_suffix "myself"
    end

    fact "for_all checks if a predicate holds for all elements" do
      [2, 4, 6, 8] |> for_all even(&1)

      ; or alternatively you could write

      [2, 4, 6, 8] |> Enum.all? even(&1)
    end

    fact "odd checks if a number is, well odd" do
      1 |> odd
    end

    fact "even checks is a number if even" do
      2 |> even
    end

    fact "roughly checks if a float within some +-delta matches" do
      0.1001 |> roughly 0.1
    end

    fact "falsey checks if expression evalulates to false" do
      nil |> falsey
    end

    fact "truthy checks if expression evaulates to true" do
      "" |> truthy
    end

    fact "equals checks ==" do
      1 - 10 |> equals -9
    end

    defexception Boom, message: "Golly gosh"

    fact "raises checks if an exception was raised" do
      fn -> raise Boom end |> raises ExampleFacts.Boom
    end
  end

  future_fact "I'm not run yet, just printed as a reminder. Like a TODO" do
    #Never run
    false |> truthy
  end

  fact "a fact without a body is much like a TODO"

  #Backwards compatible with ExUnit
  test "arithmetic" do
    assert 1 + 1 == 2
  end

end
```

## Running your tests

Use mix to run your tests:

```
mix test
```

##Custom checkers

Its simple to create your own checkers:

```elixir
  def a_thousand(actual) do
    rem(actual, 1000) |> equals 0
  end

  fact "about 1000s" do
    1000 |> a_thousand ; true
    1200 |> a_thousand ; false
  end
```

## Polite error messages:

Amrita tries its best to be polite with its errors:

![Polite error message](http://s24.postimg.org/vlj6epnmt/Screen_Shot_2013_06_01_at_22_12_16.png)

## Amrita I just want you for your checkers

If facts are not your thing nothing is stopping you from using ExUnits `test` function.
You still get all of Amrita's helpful checkers.

```elixir

defmodule IDontLikeFacts do
  use Amrita.Sweet

  test "I prefer test to fact" do
    "hello" |> contains "ello"
  end
end
```

## Bloody good show

Thanks for reading me, I appreciate it.

Have a good day.

Maybe drink some tea.
