  `Application.start/1` and `Application.start/2` are used to start applications. They are similar to `:application.start/1` and
  `:application.start/2`, however, they support starting dependencies.
  
  Allowed options (`start/2`):

  * `:dependenices` (boolean): should dependencies be recursively started if required. Returns `{:error, {:not_started, required_app}}` if 
    `false`. Default: `true`
  * `:type` (atom): restart type (:temporary, :transient, :permanent). Default: `temporary`
    Excerpt from Erlang/OTP documentation:
     * If a permanent application terminates, all other applications and the entire Erlang node are also terminated.
     * If a transient application terminates with Reason == normal, this is reported but no other applications are terminated. 
       If a transient application terminates abnormally, all other applications and the entire Erlang node are also terminated.
     * If a temporary application terminates, this is reported but no other applications are terminated.
